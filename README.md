# About the project

[Working demo](https://maciejlys.github.io/portfolio/)

My personal website where I can showcase my abilities and some of my work.

# To-do

- [ ] Change skills section.
- [ ] Add staggerChildren on some sections.

# What was used in this project?

- create-react-app
- styled-components
- react-icons
- react-scroll
- framer-motion
- react-intersection-observer
- react-tsparticles

This was also my first time using framer motion after i discovered it
and it was awesome experiance! Although it wasn't working as I expected
at the beginning but I came through. I had a lot of fun making reveal
animations and hover animations!
I was struggeling with hero section, but after I found particle.js I knew
that I want to include it in my project.
I also found react-fullpage so I am sure that I will use it in one of my next projects.
as I found it a bit to late going into this one.

# What would I change?

I think I learned alot while doing this projcet, and thats why
if I had to redo it I would definitely make sure to reuse more components
I would also make sure that animations are done correctly since the beginning
as it would ease up the process. Also I would use more of my time to create
better reusable section.
